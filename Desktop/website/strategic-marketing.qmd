-   Learned how to use data visualization tools (Tableau) to evaluate the performance of digital marketing campaigns

-   Understood that a high conversion rate does not always lead to a high ROI; customer value matters more than volume

-   Realized the importance of targeting the right audience instead of aiming for broad exposure

-   Discovered that customer preferences vary significantly by region, and using the same ad strategy everywhere can result in poor performance

-   Gained experience in deriving strategic recommendations from data, such as repositioning the brand as a premium and collectible sneaker label

-   Concluded that Nike should focus on high-ROI niche markets, such as sneaker collectors and trend-conscious buyers‚Äîand design region-specific campaigns that highlight uniqueness, style, and exclusivity

## [**Recommendations for Coffee Shops in the Post-Pandemic Era ‚òïÔ∏è**]{style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;"}

*Sep, 2024-Aug, 2025*

The COVID-19 pandemic changed how people shop and how businesses operate. Coffee shops, which usually depend on customers visiting in person, had to adjust as people worked from home and prioritized safety. This study looks at how a national coffee shop chain used digital marketing to deal with these changes. The goal is to show how online strategies can help coffee shops keep customers happy, build loyalty, and increase sales. This study also fills in gaps about how digital marketing can meet new customer needs and provide suggestions for coffee shops to grow in the future.
