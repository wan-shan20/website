Coffee shops, which usually depend on customers visiting in person, had to adjust as people worked from home and prioritized safety. This study looks at how a national coffee shop chain used digital marketing to deal with these changes. The goal is to show how online strategies can help coffee shops keep customers happy, build loyalty, and increase sales. This study also fills in gaps about how digital marketing can meet new customer needs and provide suggestions for coffee shops to grow in the future.\n\nData Source:\nSurvey\n\n\nTools:\nR\n\n\nLearning Outcomes:\n\nUnderstanding Attitudes Toward Mask-Wearing:\n\nLearn why people are willing or not willing to wear a mask (e.g., to protect themselves, protect others, or because of habit).\nSee how these attitudes affect their behavior when visiting coffee shops or other places.\n\nImproving Data Analysis Skills:\n\nChoose different types of charts based on the type of data.\nUse the right visualization tools depending on the situation."
